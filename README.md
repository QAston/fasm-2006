# Stuff I wrote in FASM in 2005-2006

I was very young back then, please don't judge, this is for entertainment purposes only. Features:

- lack of version control
- comments in Polish
- I don't know how to build these anymore, but I know I used fasm
- 16bit dos apps don't work on 64 bit windows
- win32 apps should work but don't for some reason
- I didn't really understand the difference between .com apps, .exe apps and win32 .exe apps and why they had to be so different back then.
- I didn't have internet access, my only source of knowledge was stuff I downloaded once in an internet cafe, otherwise I would've learned something else.

Dear recruiters, if you see this, this isn't an accurate repsesentation of my current skill as of 2019, thanks!

Enjoy!
